I came across the [posterdown](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown) R package which could create awesome science posters. It was great, but customising certain aspects meant digging into config files and being a final year PhD scholar, I didn't have that much time. Then, I happened to tumble down a rabbit hole browsing the [bird site](https://twitter.com/rhlvenugopal)

[Mike Morrison's](https://twitter.com/mikemorrison) video on [How to create a better research poster in less time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYk29tnxASs) got me hooked and I decided to give it a shot. Below is a scattered compilation of all the resources I went through to make my workshop poster
